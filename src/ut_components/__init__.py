    Initialize the UT Components library with application configuration.

    This function must be called on each python file you're gonna import library components
    the library with essential application information. It sets up global
    variables that will be used by various components throughout the library
    for identifying the application and handling crash reports.

    Args:
        app_name (str): The name of your Ubuntu Touch application. This is used
            for identifying the app in logs, crash reports, and other components.
        crash_report_url (Optional[str]): URL endpoint for submitting crash reports.
            If provided, components can send crash data to this URL for debugging.
            Defaults to None if crash reporting is not needed.

    Example:
        >>> from src.ut_components import setup
        >>>
        >>> # Basic setup without crash reporting
        >>> setup(app_name="MyUTApp")
