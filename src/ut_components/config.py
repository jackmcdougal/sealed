def get_config_path() -> str:
    """
    Get the XDG-compliant configuration directory path for the application.

    This function returns the standard configuration directory where the
    application should store its configuration files. It follows the XDG
    Base Directory specification, ensuring your app's configs are stored
    in the appropriate system location.

    The function respects the XDG_CONFIG_HOME environment variable if set,
    otherwise defaults to ~/.config. The application name (set via setup())
    is appended to create an app-specific configuration directory.

    Returns:
        str: The absolute path to the application's configuration directory.
             Typically ~/.config/{app_name} or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/{app_name}

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If setup() has not been called to initialize APP_NAME_

    Get the XDG-compliant cache directory path for the application.

    This function returns the standard cache directory where the
    application should store temporary cache files. It follows the XDG
    Base Directory specification, ensuring your app's cache is stored
    in the appropriate system location for temporary/regenerable data.

    The function respects the XDG_CACHE_HOME environment variable if set,

    is installed on Ubuntu Touch. This is typically used to access
    read-only application resources like QML files, icons, assets, and
    other bundled data that ships with the application package.

    The function reads the APP_DIR environment variable, which is
    automatically set by the Ubuntu Touch application confinement system
    when the app is launched.

    Returns:
