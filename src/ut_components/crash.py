    Enable or disable automatic crash reporting for the application.

    This function persists the crash reporting preference in the application's
    key-value store. When enabled, decorated functions will automatically send
    crash reports to the configured URL when exceptions occur.

    Args:
        enabled (bool): True to enable crash reporting, False to disable it.
            This preference is stored persistently and will be remembered
            across application restarts.

    Example:
        >>> from src.ut_components import setup

        >>>
        >>> # Initialize the library with crash URL

    Check if crash reporting is currently enabled for the application.

    Retrieves the crash reporting preference from the persistent key-value store.
    This function is used internally by the crash_reporter decorator to determine

    Returns:
        bool: True if crash reporting is enabled, False otherwise.

def crash_reporter(func: Callable) -> Callable:
    """
    Decorator that automatically reports unhandled exceptions to a crash reporting service.

    This decorator wraps functions to catch any unhandled exceptions and automatically
    send crash reports to the configured URL endpoint if crash reporting is enabled.
    The original exception is always re-raised to maintain normal error flow, ensuring
    that the application's error handling logic is not disrupted.

    The decorator checks if crash reporting is enabled before sending any data, respecting
    user privacy preferences. It requires the library to be initialized with a valid
    crash report URL using the setup() function.

    Args:
        func (Callable): The function to be decorated with crash reporting capability.

    Returns:
        Callable: The wrapped function that includes crash reporting functionality.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If crash reporting is enabled but CRASH_REPORT_URL_ is not configured.
        Any exception raised by the decorated function is re-raised after reporting.

    Example:
        >>> from src.ut_components import setup
        >>> from src.ut_components.crash import crash_reporter, set_crash_report
        >>>
        >>> # Initialize the library with crash reporting URL
