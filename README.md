A Bitwarden Password Manager Client for Ubuntu Touch

## Development

To run this App, you'll need a copy of Bitwarden CLI (arm build).

Currenlty Bitwarden does not provide arm linux builds on their GitHub releases.

But you can grab a pre built binary from their [Github Action](https://github.com/bitwarden/clients/actions/workflows/build-cli.yml):
- Open above link
- Search for job "CLI linux-arm64 - open source license"
- Inside the job, look for the step "Upload unix zip asset"
- Open the logs, there will be an Artifact Download URL
- Download and extract the binary inside the `lib` folder in the root of this repository

This project expects to call the binary in the location `lib/bw`.

For convenience, the binary that this application is currenlty developed can be [downloaded here](https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/sealed-bitwarden-cli/bw)
